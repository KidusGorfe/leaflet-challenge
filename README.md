# Earthquake Visualization Project

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. The visualization represents earthquake magnitudes by marker size and depths by color, offering insights into seismic activities around the globe.

ChatGPT provided valuable guidance in coding, particularly in setting up Leaflet maps, data processing, and troubleshooting.
